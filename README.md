This RMD file is used to predict fitbit users' excercises. I used Random Forest (RF) as the predictive method in model fitting, because Random Forest usually has high predictive performance and yield very low error rate should be very low error rate. All varaibles from the processed training data were used as predictors. I applied three times of 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate out-of-sample error. The final model is presented. The results from the confusion matrix model demonstated that the error rate is very low for all 5 classes.
I also compared two different methods, out-of-bag estimate and cross validation, the results were similiar, thought the error mean was a little bit higher from the cross validation.
